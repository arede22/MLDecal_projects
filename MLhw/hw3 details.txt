PCA

K principal components from X
Interpolate between random rows of X
Sample points in lower dim subpace
Invert PCA to generate new faces

rows of X live in R^D (D = 3072)
principal components of x = sequence of best linear apporximations to X in lower dim subspace R^Q where Q <= D
f(lambda) = mu + V(Q) * lambda >> linear transformation from space R^Q to R^D
mu - position in space R^D - and V(Q) - unitary matrix that maps vector lambda from R^Q to R^D - are important parameters

Goal: minimize reconstruction error

mu = (1/N) sum from 1 to N of xi (X row in position i)
lambdai = V(Q)^T * (xi - mu)

SVD X = U sigma V^T
U = N X D orthogonal matrix
U sigma represents principal components, directions with highest variance
solution for V(Q) is to take the first Q columns of matrix V
